Welcome to Fisdap's front end case study! 

## Before you start

You should have:

- the git command line tool or a Git tools like SourceTree installed on your computer.
- a Github account
- your editor or IDE of choice
- your personality / creativity

There are four parts in this process:

1. Getting started
2. Answer several short answer questions
3. Complete a few code tasks
4. Finish up and submit your case study in the form of a Github pull request

Please feel free to take liberties with the assignments and be as creative or straight forward as you like. This is not a test but rather a way for us to get to know how you address basic problems. It is also a chance for you to show off any of your particularly awesome skills, libraries or frameworks that you like to work with.  There aren't wrong answers. All we ask is that you be prepared to talk through your choices in a general sense if you're asked to join us for an in-person interview.

## The case study

### Getting started

1. Fork this repository by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right hand corner.
2. Once you have forked the repository, navigate to your private fork on github.
3. Clone your fork using the url on your fork's page. The url should look something like `https://github.com/myusername/basic-front-end-case-study.git` or `git@github.com:myusername/basic-front-end-case-study.git` where `myusername` is your Github username.
4. Open the cloned folder on your computer and continue to the short answer section.

### Short answer questions

1. Open the folder titled 01-short-answer.
2. Edit the file called ANSWERS.md and fill out the questions as best you can. If you don't know an answer or the question is not applicable, take an opportunity to talk to us about a particular framework or show off some code you're proud of.
3. Make sure to fill out the fields for your name so that we can identify you. :)
4. Commit your changes.

### Code tasks

1. There are several other folders. Each should be labeled in the form 02-description-of-task, 03-another-task-description, etc.
2. Open each of these folders, view the README.md in the folder and complete the tasks to the best of your ability, commiting your changes after you complete each task. 

### Once you've finished

1. Once you've completed and commited all the tasks, please `git push` your changes up to your fork.
2. The last task is to go onto your fork and create a pull request. This will notify us that you have changes you'd like to merge back to our project.
3. Note: we will probably never merge your changes but this will let us take a look at your code. 

That's it! Please let us know if you have any questions at all.
